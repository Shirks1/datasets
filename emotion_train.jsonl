That means I missed four days of emails. I haven't done that in a LONG time.\n\nBut I had good reason.\n\nI had my first Collective event this weekend here in Boise. Members of The Collective flew from across the world to attend the event, and we had a great time. (The Collective is my mastermind group where we focus on growing and monetizing email lists.)\n\nPerhaps too good of a time if you look at my lack of sleep stats on my oura ring. (Although I don't believe you can have too good of a time.)\n\nOn Friday night we all met up for cocktails. I told myself I'd be going home at 10pm so I could get some good sleep. I got home at 2am. The next day I spent literally 8 hours on stage.\n\nWe went DEEP on Reality Engineering. We covered a new ad strategy of running ads direct to FB groups. One guy at the event is getting 2,000 new opt ins a day...and he's only been running traffic for less than a month. And it's his first online business.\n\nWe did a deep dive on Pay What You Want funnels and covered new strategies on how to increase Average Order Value.\n\nThen we spent the rest of the day on hot seats where we helped people work through their biggest problems.\n\nI also may have told a story where I ended up crying on stage.\n\nIt was a FULL day.\n\nAfterwards I went home and took a 13-minute nap. Hopped in the ice bath and hyped myself up for my comedy show that night. Then I proceeded to do an hour and 45 minutes of stand-up starting a bit after 9pm. Then we went out until the bars closed at 2am yet again...I was asleep around 3:30am.\n\nThen I woke up at 9am to watch Liverpool play. I had my own soccer match at 11am and we had no subs, so I played a full 90 minutes in the 100-degree heat. (I scored 3 goals in the first 20 minutes. I was so stoked I just needed to publicly brag real quick.)\n\nThen I met back up with The Collective members for brunch. I headed home for an ice bath and then met up with the ones who were left yet again. I fell asleep around 3am...again. It was INSANE.\n\nI don't normally like to stay up late. 2am is about as late as I like on weekends. Multiple 3am nights in a row was too much for the body to handle.\n\nI spent all of Monday taking naps and recovering. Yesterday I got back into the swing of things and finished a MASSIVE project that I'm sharing with The Collective today.\n\nLast night I had a late night indoor soccer match, but I'm finally feeling recovered from everything. It was one of the longest weekends of my life...but also incredibly fun and rewarding.\n\nSo what's the point of this story? 1. To explain why I didn't email for a few days and share a lesson. Everyday I don't email my list is technically a missed opportunity to either make money or deepen my relationship with my subscribers. But instead of beating myself up for missing 4 days, I accept that I had important stuff going on.\n\n2. To maybe make you feel some FOMO for missing out on The Collective event. If you're interested in joining, you can apply here. If you qualify based on the application, you'll talk to me on the phone to see if you're a good fit.\n\nThat's all for now. This afternoon I'm headed off to the mountains for some activity that offends some people.\n\nBut I have some exciting stuff to announce as well.\n\nTalk soon,\nFirst Name \"way less exhausted now\" Last Name"}

Some never do it…no matter how wealthy they become. I have friends who make a million dollars per year and fly coach. I personally believe that’s dumb.\n\nI only fly coach if the flight is under 2 hours…even then I tend to fly first class unless the price difference is insane.\n\nThe reason it’s important to book a first class flight before you’re ready to…especially if you feel uncomfortable with it…is because it will shift your view of reality.\n\nI used to think first class flights were dumb cuz you could use that money on your trip. Then I heard someone say 'when you fly first class, the flight becomes PART of the trip.'\n\nThat stood out to me. I always viewed the flight as just getting to the destination. Now I see the flight as the start of the journey. Part of it.\n\nOn top of all that, it’s WAY easier to work in first class if you gotta get shit done.\n\nI do some of my best writing on planes…and it’s way harder to type in a tiny seat. I’m a bigger guy who takes up a decent amount of space. Typing in economy makes me feel like a T-Rex and sometimes it makes my forearms cramp.\n\nSo book a first class ticket at least once. Even if it’s a short simple flight.\n\nExperience first class and you won’t wanna go back to economy.\n\nIt’s also interesting to see how it makes you feel. Do you feel unworthy? Douchey? Embarrassed? Entitled? Let the feelings come up. They are the guide to your money blocks.\n\nAnd if you'd like to learn how to book first class flights without paying for them...come to the training call I'm doing with my buddy Eli the Travel Guy in an hour. The training is at 11am pacific time today.\n\nHe'll show you how to get a ton of points and fly all over for free.\n\n>>> Click here to register for the call\n\nTalk soon,\nFirst Name \"first class is more fun\" Last Name"}

Or someone that's where I want to be in some part of my life. Could be someone who's in great shape, or runs a great business, or is just flat out interesting.\n\nI love to see what a full day in their life is actually like.\n\nSo recently we made a video of a 'Day in my life.' My video guy put quite a lot of effort into making it a LEGIT video with some great cinematography.\n\nI'd love for you to check it out Youtube and let me know what you think. Let me know if you want me to make more of them.\n\nThe goal was to show you how you can have a whole lot of fun while making quite a bit of $$$.\n\nThe title is 'A Day in the Life of Running a 7 Figure Business.' It's quite entertaining.\n\nOur day involved an avalanche, snowboarding, ice baths, writing emails, a drunk navy seal, and some Shameball.\n\nIt was quite a day.\n\nGive it a watch. Like the video if you enjoy it. Comment on it. Do all the things that make Youtube happy if you like it.\n\nYou'll even see how much money I made that day while we filmed.\n\n>>> Click here to watch the video now\n\nTalk soon,\nFirst Name \"it was a good day\" Last Name"}

It's how I've helped hundreds of people do the same thing.\n\nThere ARE easier ways to make money overall.\n\nIf I NEEDED money I'd buy a $150 power washer off of Amazon and go door to door offering to power wash people's houses. But I'd have to work for every dollar. And the only way to scale up income would be to hire people and deal with a bunch of bullshit.\n\nWhen it comes to writing emails for other people you can go from zero to $5,000 a month...then up to about $40,000 per month before you'd have to hire anyone.\n\nAll you gotta do is write emails like the one you're reading right now. Other companies will HAPPILY pay you for them.\n\nSo if you wanna learn this skill and how to find clients, come to my free live training tomorrow. I'll show you how.\n\nThe call is tomorrow (Thursday) at 9am pacific time. And it will be recorded.
